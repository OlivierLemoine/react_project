# 3D Learning
## An IDW React Project

## What is it?
A platform to learn gender in german. It is difficult for a non-german speaker to remember which article to use. Thus, we provide a funny way to learn it.

All the new learners are welcome to play with our site!

## How it works?
Users are able to add new words in a collaborative DB. With some minigames, they may learn the gender of german words.

## What games?

* Drag and drop article on top of a word.
* Defend a planet from attacking 

## Optional
We would like to add a translation option if we have time.
